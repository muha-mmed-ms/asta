# Easy Way to Add Interactive Map with Location Markers

The error you got was because Google Maps embed URLs with 'pb' parameters are complex and can't be manually created. 

## ✅ Best Solution: Google My Maps (5 Minutes Setup)

This is the **easiest and most reliable** way to show all your locations with markers. No API key needed!

### Step-by-Step Guide:

#### 1. Create Your Map
1. Go to **https://www.google.com/maps/d/** (sign in to Google)
2. Click **"+ CREATE A NEW MAP"** (red button)

#### 2. Add Your 4 Locations

**For Asta Arise:**
- In the search box, type: `8/91, CP Ramaswamy Road, Alwarpet, Chennai - 600018`
- Click **"Add to map"** (+ button appears)
- Click the marker, click the pencil icon, name it "Asta Arise"
- Click Save

**For Asta AVM:**
- Search: `AVM Studio Complex, 38, Arcot Road, Vadapalani, Chennai 600 026`
- Click **"Add to map"**
- Name it "Asta AVM"
- Click Save

**For Asta Aura:**
- Search: `Padmavathiar Salai, Gopalapuram, Chennai, Tamil Nadu 600086`
- Click **"Add to map"**
- Name it "Asta Aura"
- Click Save

**For Corporate Office:**
- Search: `No 2, Ethiraj Salai, C-in-C Road, Egmore, Tamil Nadu, 600008`
- Click **"Add to map"**
- Name it "Corporate Office"
- Click Save

#### 3. Customize (Optional)
- Click on any marker → paint bucket icon → choose your brand color
- Add descriptions or images to each location

#### 4. Get the Embed Code

1. Click the **Share** button (next to the map title)
2. In the popup:
   - Change from "Private" to **"Anyone with the link"**
   - Click **Done**
3. Click the **3 dots (⋮) menu** next to Preview
4. Select **"Embed on my website"**
5. You'll see HTML code like:
```html
<iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=XXXXX..." width="640" height="480"></iframe>
```

6. **Copy ONLY the URL** (the part inside `src="..."`)
   - Example: `https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=1AbC123...`

#### 5. Update Your Website

1. Open `src/components/LocationMap.jsx`
2. Find line 9 where it says `src="/images/map.png"`
3. Replace the entire `<img>` tag with:

```jsx
<iframe
  src="YOUR_COPIED_URL_HERE"
  width="100%"
  height="100%"
  style={{ border: 0 }}
  allowFullScreen=""
  loading="lazy"
  referrerPolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"
  title="Asta Properties Locations"
/>
```

4. Save the file

### Done! 🎉

Your map will now show:
- ✅ All 4 Asta Properties with markers
- ✅ Interactive (zoom, pan, street view)
- ✅ Clickable markers with info
- ✅ Custom colors/icons
- ✅ Works on all devices

---

## Alternative: Keep Static Image (Current Setup)

If you prefer to keep it simple, the current setup uses the static map image at `/images/map.png`. 

**Pros:**
- ✅ Fast loading
- ✅ No external dependencies
- ✅ Works immediately

**Cons:**
- ❌ Not interactive
- ❌ Can't zoom/pan
- ❌ Need to update image manually

## Why Not Use Regular Google Maps Embed?

Regular Google Maps embed URLs have complex 'pb' parameters that can only be generated by Google's interface. That's why manually creating them causes the "Invalid pb parameter" error.

**Google My Maps** is specifically designed for embedding custom maps with multiple locations, and it generates the correct URL automatically.

## Need Help?

If you have any issues:
1. Make sure the map is set to "Anyone with the link" or "Public"
2. Copy the complete URL including `?mid=...`
3. The URL should start with `https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=`

The map will update automatically if you make changes in Google My Maps later!
